### Setup

Run `setup.sh` to download data necessary for this project.

`data.sh` is provided as documentation and a demonstration of how source data
can be processed to produce the `bird-species.sqlite` file. Running `data.sh`
directly is not recommended unless you have a fairly beefy box and a lot of
time.
